# Hi, I'm Katy.
I like improving experiences through creative applications of technology and baking cookies for my friends.
After growing up in the US and Canada I set off to explore the world and am currently calling [Brisbane, Australia](https://media.giphy.com/media/E6AKG0k1r2vx6/giphy.gif) home.

## Currently
Studing Media and Communication at the Queensland University of Technology, expected to graduate in November 2017.
